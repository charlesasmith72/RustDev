Great job grabbing the BIOS list for your **ASRock B650M-C**!

### ✅ **Compatibility Check for Ryzen 9 7950X**

- **The Ryzen 9 7950X has been supported since the earliest BIOS versions for the B650M-C.**  
- This means: **Your current BIOS (1.24 from 2023, which you previously shared) already supports the Ryzen 9 7950X.**

### ⚠️ **Should You Update the BIOS Before Installing Ryzen 9 7950X?**

Here’s the **current recommended logic:**

| BIOS Version | Ryzen 9 7950X Support | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **1.09 (or newer)** | ✅ Supported | You’re good to go even with older versions. |
| **2.10+ (recommended)** | ✅ Supported | Improves stability, RAM compatibility, and future-proofing. |
| **3.18 (latest Beta as of 2025)** | ✅ Supported | Adds support for newer CPUs (Ryzen 9000 series Phoenix), but not required for 7950X. |

### 💻 **Key Features in Newer BIOS Versions**

| Version | Key Benefits |
|---|---|
| **2.10** | AGESA 1.1.0.3 - Improved system stability. |
| **3.06+** | AGESA 1.2.0.0 - Added Ryzen 9000 support (future-proof). |
| **3.12** | Adds support for Ryzen 7 9800X3D (future CPUs). |
| **3.18 (Latest Beta)** | AGESA 1.2.0.3a - Fixes DRAM timing issues & enhances memory support. |

### ⚠️ **Special Note for RTX 40 Series GPUs (Important for You)**

This section at the top of the screenshot is critical:

> "RTX 40 series GPU output can get interrupted during BIOS update from BIOS 1.09. Temporarily adjust the BIOS option [Display Priority] to [Internal Graphic] under BIOS\Advanced\Onboard Devices Configuration."

Since you have an **RTX 4070 Ti**, you’ll want to:

1. Enter BIOS before the update.
2. Go to:
   ```
   Advanced > Onboard Devices Configuration
   ```
3. Set **Display Priority to Internal Graphics** before updating.
4. After the update, set it back to **PCIe** if needed.

### ✅ **Final Recommendations**

| Step | Action |
|---|---|
| **Check Current BIOS Version** | ✅ You have 1.24 — supports 7950X |
| **Should You Update?** | ✅ Recommended (but not required) |
| **Best BIOS Version to Install?** | ✅ 3.10 or 3.15 (for stability + compatibility) |
| **Handle RTX 40 GPU Issue?** | ✅ Yes, set **Display Priority** to Internal Graphics before updating. |
