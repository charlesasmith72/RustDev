# 🔧 **Step-by-Step: Upgrade Ryzen 7 7700 to Ryzen 9 7950X**

---

# 📋 **Step 1 - Check Compatibility**

✅ **Motherboard Check**  
- Ryzen 7 7700 and Ryzen 9 7950X both use **AM5 socket**.
- If you’re using a **B650, X670, or A620 motherboard**, you’re good.
- Check your **motherboard’s compatibility list** on the manufacturer’s website to confirm it supports the 7950X (most AM5 boards do).

✅ **BIOS Update**  
- Some boards might need a **BIOS update** to fully support the Ryzen 9 7950X.
- Visit your **motherboard manufacturer’s website**, find your model, and check for the **latest BIOS update**.
- Follow the instructions from your motherboard maker to update the BIOS **before swapping CPUs**.

---

# 🔧 **Step 2 - Gather Tools and Parts**

✅ What You Need:
- **AMD Ryzen 9 7950X CPU**
- **Thermal paste** (optional but recommended — some coolers include it)
- **Compatible CPU cooler** (7950X runs hotter than 7700, so make sure your cooler can handle 170W)
- **Screwdriver**
- **Isopropyl alcohol & lint-free cloth (for cleaning old thermal paste)**

---

# ⚠️ **Step 3 - Prepare the PC**

1. **Turn Off the PC.**
2. **Unplug everything.**
3. **Lay the case flat** on a table.
4. **Ground yourself** to avoid static (touch metal like the case).

---

# 🔩 **Step 4 - Remove the Old CPU (Ryzen 7 7700)**

1. Remove the **CPU cooler** (unscrew and gently twist it off).
2. Clean off the old **thermal paste** from the cooler and the Ryzen 7 7700 using **isopropyl alcohol** and a cloth.
3. Lift the **CPU retention arm** next to the socket.
4. Gently lift the Ryzen 7 7700 straight out.

---

# ⚙️ **Step 5 - Install the Ryzen 9 7950X**

1. Line up the **gold triangle** on the corner of the Ryzen 9 7950X with the **triangle on the socket**.
2. Drop the CPU gently into place — **no force required**.
3. Lower the **retention arm** to secure the CPU.

---

# 🧴 **Step 6 - Apply Thermal Paste**

- Apply **a small pea-sized dot** of thermal paste in the center of the CPU.
- If your cooler already has pre-applied thermal paste, you can skip this step.

---

# ❄️ **Step 7 - Reinstall or Upgrade CPU Cooler**

- Reinstall your **CPU cooler** (make sure it’s tightened evenly).
- If you’re upgrading your cooler (recommended for the 7950X), follow the cooler’s instructions.

---

# 🔌 **Step 8 - Boot Up and Check BIOS**

1. Plug everything back in.
2. Power on the system.
3. **Enter BIOS** (usually by pressing **Delete** or **F2** right when the PC turns on).
4. Check that the BIOS **detects the Ryzen 9 7950X** correctly.
5. If needed, enable **EXPO (for RAM overclocking)**.

---

# 🧰 **Step 9 - Test and Monitor Temps**

1. Boot into Windows or Linux.
2. Download **HWMonitor** (Windows) or **lm-sensors** (Linux) to check your **CPU temperatures**.
3. If temps are too high (above ~90°C under load), consider upgrading the cooler.

---

# 🕹️ **Optional - Update Power Plan & Settings**

- In Windows, set your **Power Plan to High Performance** for best CPU performance.
- If you want more balanced temps, use the **AMD Ryzen Master** tool to fine-tune power settings.

---

# ✅ **Step 10 - Enjoy the Upgrade!**

- You should now have **double the cores, double the threads**, and **faster clock speeds**.
- Perfect for:
    - **Gaming + streaming simultaneously**
    - **Compiling Rust projects faster**
    - **Running Docker containers without lag**
    - **Video editing with 4K/8K footage**

# ⚠️ **Important Warnings**

- The **Ryzen 9 7950X uses a lot more power (170W TDP)** than the Ryzen 7 7700 (65W TDP), so:
    - Make sure your **cooler is strong enough**.
    - Check your **power supply (PSU)** — at least **750W recommended** for high-end systems.
- If you skip the BIOS update (on older boards), the system **may fail to boot with the new CPU**.
