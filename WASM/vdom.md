Good question ‚Äî this is getting deep into high-performance territory.  
Let‚Äôs break it down based on what you're asking:

---

**Goal**:  
- WASM app has a **virtual DOM** (VDOM) internally.  
- It also has its **own JavaScript engine** inside WASM (not using the browser‚Äôs engine natively).
- You want to **inject** or **sync** your internal VDOM into the real browser DOM **as fast as possible**.

---

### Best / Fastest Architecture

‚úÖ **1. Direct DOM API Calls via `web_sys` / `wasm-bindgen` (skip any JS interop beyond the binding itself).**  
  - Instead of generating JavaScript *code* inside your engine and asking the browser to run it, **directly call `web_sys` DOM methods** to create, update, and move real DOM nodes.
  - Treat your internal VDOM like a diff engine: detect *what changed*, and then **batch the minimum set of real DOM operations**.

‚úÖ **2. Batching Changes (Microtasks or Animation Frame).**
  - Queue all DOM changes inside WASM.
  - Flush them together during `requestAnimationFrame()` or a single microtask.
  - Example strategy:  
    ```rust
    let mut pending_dom_changes: Vec<DomMutation> = vec![];
    // during the next frame:
    for change in pending_dom_changes { apply(change); }
    pending_dom_changes.clear();
    ```

‚úÖ **3. Minimize String Allocations / Cloning.**
  - If your engine generates tag names, IDs, or classes, try to **intern** them.
  - If possible, **pass interned strings** (cheap pointers) instead of allocating new JS strings for every call.

‚úÖ **4. Avoid TextNode Thrashing.**
  - TextNodes are expensive.
  - If a text value changes frequently (e.g., a clock), **cache** the `TextNode` object and only update `.nodeValue`, not remove/create new nodes.

‚úÖ **5. Keep Node References in WASM.**
  - Store `web_sys::Element` or `web_sys::Node` references inside your Rust structs.
  - Then you can efficiently update/remove without doing slow `querySelector` lookups.

‚úÖ **6. (Optional) Serialize Diffs to JS for Mass Injection (only if necessary).**
  - If batching WASM calls is too slow at the boundary, you could serialize a whole change set into a compact JSON or binary format, and hand that off to a tiny helper JS function to apply it using plain JS.
  - **But** direct `web_sys` is almost always faster unless you are sending thousands of diffs per frame.

### Sketch of How the WASM Side Would Look

```rust
struct VDomNode {
    tag_name: &'static str,
    attributes: HashMap<String, String>,
    children: Vec<VDomNode>,
    dom_ref: Option<web_sys::Element>, // Real DOM node, if attached
}

impl VDomNode {
    fn render(&mut self, parent: &web_sys::Element) {
        let doc = web_sys::window().unwrap().document().unwrap();
        let elem = doc.create_element(self.tag_name).unwrap();

        for (k, v) in &self.attributes {
            elem.set_attribute(k, v).unwrap();
        }

        for child in &mut self.children {
            child.render(&elem);
        }

        parent.append_child(&elem).unwrap();
        self.dom_ref = Some(elem);
    }
}
```

And you can optimize even more by diffing existing `dom_ref`s instead of re-creating.

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Summary of Fastest Practices

| Technique                     | Why it‚Äôs fast |
|--------------------------------|---------------|
| Direct `web_sys` DOM calls     | No JS parsing, no `eval`, no reflection overhead |
| Batching DOM mutations         | Avoid layout thrashing |
| Caching Node references        | No lookup time |
| Interning / minimizing string passing | Reduce memory allocations |
| Updating only what changed     | Avoid expensive node recreations |
| Optional: Full batch diff transfer to a tiny JS worker | If boundary overhead is your bottleneck |

If you want, I can show you a **full demo**:  
- Tiny VDOM in Rust.  
- Update cycles with batched DOM changes.  
- Running entirely inside WASM without relying on external JS engines.  

Would you like that? üöÄ  
(Also: is your custom JS engine something like QuickJS compiled to WASM, or something even lighter?)
