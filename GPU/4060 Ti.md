Thanks for the screenshot! Based on what you're showing under **Display adapters**, here's what it means:

---

# üñ•Ô∏è **Your Current GPUs**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **AMD Radeon(TM) Graphics**  
This is **your integrated GPU** ‚Äî meaning it's built into your **CPU** (likely your AMD Ryzen processor).  
- ‚úÖ **Good for basic tasks** like web browsing, watching videos, and light work.
- ‚ùå **Not ideal for gaming or heavy graphics work.**

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Ti**  
This is your **dedicated graphics card (discrete GPU)**.  
- ‚úÖ **Great for gaming, 3D modeling, video editing, and even some AI tasks.**
- ‚úÖ This is the **primary GPU you want to use for gaming, creative work, and WebGPU/WebGL development.**

# üîÑ **Why Do You Have Two GPUs?**

- **The Radeon graphics** comes **inside your AMD CPU** ‚Äî it's always there.
- **The RTX 4060 Ti** is your powerful, dedicated graphics card, which takes over for heavy-duty work.
- **Your computer automatically switches** between them depending on the task.
    - Light tasks = Use AMD integrated GPU (saves power).
    - Games & heavy apps = Use NVIDIA RTX 4060 Ti (better performance).

# ‚ö° **Summary Table**

| GPU | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **AMD Radeon(TM) Graphics** | Integrated (inside CPU) | Basic tasks (web, video, light apps) |
| **NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Ti** | Dedicated (separate card) | Gaming, 3D work, video editing, AI |

# üî• Optional Next Steps
Would you like me to help you:
- ‚úÖ **Check GPU speeds (clocks, VRAM)?**
- ‚úÖ **Show how to make sure games & apps always use the RTX 4060 Ti?**
- ‚úÖ **Explain how your system decides which GPU to use?**

Let me know!
