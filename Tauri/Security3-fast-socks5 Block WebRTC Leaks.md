### **🔍 What is WebRTC and What Are WebRTC Leaks?**

#### **🛠 What is WebRTC?**
**WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication)** is a browser feature that allows direct peer-to-peer (P2P) communication between devices without requiring an intermediate server. It is used for:
- **Video and audio calls** (e.g., Zoom, Google Meet)
- **Live streaming**
- **File sharing**
- **Real-time multiplayer gaming**

**🔗 WebRTC is built into browsers like:**  
- Google Chrome  
- Mozilla Firefox  
- Microsoft Edge  
- Safari  
- Chromium-based apps (Tauri, Electron, etc.)

**✅ Advantages of WebRTC:**  
✔ Faster communication (direct P2P instead of routing through a server).  
✔ Reduces bandwidth and latency.  

**❌ Disadvantages:**  
❌ **Exposes your real IP address**, even if you're using a VPN or proxy.  
❌ **Bypasses network-level protections**, leading to privacy leaks.

#### **🔍 What is a WebRTC Leak?**
A **WebRTC Leak** occurs when a website or service retrieves your **real IP address** despite using a VPN, SOCKS5 proxy, or Tor. This happens because WebRTC:
1. **Bypasses VPNs and Proxies** by making direct connections using your **device’s local IP stack**.
2. **Reveals Your Private & Public IPs** to websites, trackers, or hackers.
3. **Uses STUN/TURN Servers** that request your real IP to establish a peer-to-peer connection.

**📢 Example of a WebRTC Leak:**
Even if you connect to a VPN, visiting a **WebRTC-enabled website** can **still expose your real IP address**.

**🛑 If WebRTC is leaking your real IP, it will show your private/public IP under "Local IP Address".**

#### **📌 How to Prevent WebRTC Leaks in a Tauri App**
To **block WebRTC leaks in Tauri**, you need to:
✔ **Disable WebRTC in Tauri’s `tauri.conf.json` (Chromium/WebKit settings).**  
✔ **Use JavaScript overrides to prevent WebRTC access in the frontend.**  
✔ **Modify Tauri’s Rust backend to block WebRTC at the system level.**

### **🛠 Is WebRTC a Security Risk When Fetching Data via IPFS or Blockchain APIs?**
**No, WebRTC is not a direct issue if you're only fetching data from IPFS or blockchain APIs** because WebRTC primarily affects **peer-to-peer (P2P) connections in web browsers**. However, it **can still pose indirect privacy risks** depending on how your app interacts with the network.

---

## **🔍 When is WebRTC a Security Risk?**
**WebRTC leaks only occur when:**
1. **Your application or browser allows WebRTC peer-to-peer communication**.
2. **The API or website you connect to uses WebRTC to gather your real IP address**.
3. **You’re interacting with an interface that supports WebRTC calls (e.g., dApps, Web3 wallets, or IPFS gateways that enable WebRTC connections)**.

## **🔹 Is WebRTC a Risk for Fetching IPFS or Blockchain API Data?**
| **Scenario** | **Is WebRTC a Risk?** | **Why?** |
|-------------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| **Fetching blockchain data (Ethereum, Cardano, Bitcoin, etc.)** | ❌ No | API requests use HTTP(S), not WebRTC. |
| **Fetching data from an IPFS gateway (e.g., Infura, Pinata, Web3.storage)** | ❌ No | Data retrieval is over HTTPS, no WebRTC. |
| **Interacting with IPFS P2P nodes directly** | ⚠️ Maybe | If using a **browser-based** IPFS client, WebRTC might expose your real IP. |
| **Using a Web3 wallet (MetaMask, Phantom, Keplr) that enables WebRTC P2P connections** | ⚠️ Maybe | Some dApps use WebRTC for direct wallet-node communication. |
| **Using a dVPN (Decentralized VPN)** | ⚠️ Maybe | If the dVPN app or service enables WebRTC for routing, your real IP could be leaked. |

✅ **If you're only making API calls to blockchain or IPFS gateways, WebRTC is not a problem.**  
❌ **If you're interacting with P2P nodes directly, WebRTC leaks could expose your real IP.**

---

## **🔹 When Should You Disable WebRTC?**
You **should disable WebRTC** if:
- **You’re running an IPFS node** (not just fetching data via HTTP).
- **You’re using dApps that interact with decentralized peer nodes.**
- **You’re using a dVPN that could route traffic via WebRTC.**
- **Your application may interact with other peers (even if unintended).**

✅ **If you only fetch blockchain or IPFS data via HTTPS APIs, WebRTC is not a concern.**  
❌ **If your app or browser could make P2P WebRTC connections, disabling WebRTC prevents IP leaks.**
