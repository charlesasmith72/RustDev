### **🔍 What is WebRTC and What Are WebRTC Leaks?**

#### **🛠 What is WebRTC?**
**WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication)** is a browser feature that allows direct peer-to-peer (P2P) communication between devices without requiring an intermediate server. It is used for:
- **Video and audio calls** (e.g., Zoom, Google Meet)
- **Live streaming**
- **File sharing**
- **Real-time multiplayer gaming**

**🔗 WebRTC is built into browsers like:**  
- Google Chrome  
- Mozilla Firefox  
- Microsoft Edge  
- Safari  
- Chromium-based apps (Tauri, Electron, etc.)

**✅ Advantages of WebRTC:**  
✔ Faster communication (direct P2P instead of routing through a server).  
✔ Reduces bandwidth and latency.  

**❌ Disadvantages:**  
❌ **Exposes your real IP address**, even if you're using a VPN or proxy.  
❌ **Bypasses network-level protections**, leading to privacy leaks.

#### **🔍 What is a WebRTC Leak?**
A **WebRTC Leak** occurs when a website or service retrieves your **real IP address** despite using a VPN, SOCKS5 proxy, or Tor. This happens because WebRTC:
1. **Bypasses VPNs and Proxies** by making direct connections using your **device’s local IP stack**.
2. **Reveals Your Private & Public IPs** to websites, trackers, or hackers.
3. **Uses STUN/TURN Servers** that request your real IP to establish a peer-to-peer connection.

**📢 Example of a WebRTC Leak:**
Even if you connect to a VPN, visiting a **WebRTC-enabled website** can **still expose your real IP address**.

**🛑 If WebRTC is leaking your real IP, it will show your private/public IP under "Local IP Address".**

#### **📌 How to Prevent WebRTC Leaks in a Tauri App**
To **block WebRTC leaks in Tauri**, you need to:
✔ **Disable WebRTC in Tauri’s `tauri.conf.json` (Chromium/WebKit settings).**  
✔ **Use JavaScript overrides to prevent WebRTC access in the frontend.**  
✔ **Modify Tauri’s Rust backend to block WebRTC at the system level.**
