|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `rustup install <toolchain>`     | Installs a specific toolchain (e.g., `rustup install nightly`).                                |
| `rustup update`                  | Updates all installed toolchains to their latest versions.                                     |
| `rustup default <toolchain>`     | Sets the default toolchain (e.g., `rustup default stable`).                                    |
| `rustup override set <toolchain>`| Sets a specific toolchain for a directory or project.                                          |
| `rustup show`                    | Displays the currently active toolchain and its components.                                    |
| `rustup component add <name>`    | Installs additional components (e.g., `rustfmt`, `clippy`).                                    |
| `rustup target add <target>`     | Adds a target for cross-compilation (e.g., `wasm32-unknown-unknown` for WebAssembly).          |
| `rustup uninstall <toolchain>`   | Removes a previously installed toolchain.                                                     |
