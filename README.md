# **Master the Rust programming language from A-Z. Includes projects, quizzes, and more. Beginners welcome!**[...](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-to-code-with-rust/learn/quiz/6612445)

**Learn to Code with Rust** is a comprehensive introduction to programming in Rust, one of the fastest-growing programming languages in the world. Rust powers codebases in companies and products like Amazon, Microsoft, Firefox, Discord, and more. It is used in a variety of disciplines including web development, CLI programs, build tools, and databases.

Over more than 50 hours of video content, we'll tackle the language from A to Z, covering everything you need to know about Rust to be an effective developer.

The course is jam-packed with:

* 50+ hours of video, with new content added frequently
* Multiple-choice quizzes
* Coding challenges and projects
* Section reviews

**Learn to Code with Rust** is designed from the ground up to take you from novice to professional. Complete beginners are welcome; no prior experience is needed! Over 300+ videos, we'll work our way from language fundamentals to advanced features. Topics covered include...

* Setup & Installation
* Variables
* Data types
* Functions and Methods
* Control Flow
* Ownership and References
* Slices
* Structs
* Enums
* Generics
* Option and Result Enums
* Vectors
* Project Structure
* Strings
* Hash Maps
* Error Handling
* Traits
* Lifetimes
* Closures
* Iterators
* ...and more!

Throughout the entire journey, I'll be coding alongside you step by step in the code editor. You'll also be able to test your knowledge through numerous coding challenges, quizzes, and written assignments.

Rust is known to be a challenging language to learn. For many concepts, I had to browse through different books, articles, and videos to understand what was happening. My hope here is to demystify the concepts and make it easier for new students to learn the language.
