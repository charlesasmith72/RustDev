## Absolutely — this is the *critical glue* that connects your Web UI (HTML/JS) to your Native Rust/WASM engine in PDX.

---

# What is Inter-Process Communication (IPC) in JS ↔ Native Apps?

### Simple Definition:
> IPC is how your WebView's JS (Frontend) talks to Rust or C++ (Backend) when running inside a native app.

---

## Why Do You Need It?
→ Because:
- JS in WebView = sandboxed (no filesystem, no crypto, no OS access)
- Native Rust = full control (filesystem, Wasmtime, WGPU, Crypto)

### So IPC is the controlled bridge that lets:
- JS ask Rust to do something native
- Rust send data/results back to JS

---

## Think of it like:
| Browser | Desktop Rust App |
|---------|-----------------|
| `fetch('/api/data')` | becomes | `window.ipc.postMessage()` |
| API server response | becomes | Rust's native response |

---

# Typical IPC Design in Desktop Apps:
```
+---------------------------------+
| WebView UI (HTML / JS / CSS)   |
|  - Rspack Bundle Output        |
+---------------------------------+
         ⇅ (IPC Bridge)
+---------------------------------+
| Native App (Rust / C++ / etc)  |
| - Wasmtime | WGPU | PrimJS     |
+---------------------------------+
```

---

## IPC Message Format (Usually JSON)

### From JS to Rust:
```js
window.ipc.postMessage({
   action: "decryptCipher",
   args: { path: "cipher.wasm" }
})
```

---

### From Rust to JS:
```rust
webview.eval(&format!("onCipherResult({})", json_data));
```

OR with a listener:
```js
window.ipc.onMessage((event) => {
   const result = event.data
})
```

---

# IPC in WRY (Rust WebView)
> WRY provides:
- JS → Rust = `.set_ipc_handler(|msg| { ... })`
- Rust → JS = `.eval(js_code)`

---

## Example Flow: Decrypt a PDX Cipher

### 1. User clicks button in Web UI
```js
window.ipc.postMessage({ action: "decryptCipher", args: { path: "x.cipher" } })
```

### 2. Rust Handles it
```rust
webview.set_ipc_handler(|msg| {
   match msg.action.as_str() {
      "decryptCipher" => {
          let result = run_cipher_wasm(args);
          webview.eval(&format!("onCipherResult({})", result));
      }
      _ => {}
   }
})
```

---

## Security Benefits of IPC:
| Feature | Why It's Safe |
|---------|---------------|
| Action whitelist | Only handle specific actions |
| No direct access | JS can't touch filesystem directly |
| Input validation | Rust owns logic, not JS |
| Rust memory safety | No memory leaks from JS world |

---

# Types of IPC Bridges per Engine:

| Engine | IPC Mechanism | Notes |
|--------|----------------|------|
| WRY / Tao | `.postMessage` / `.eval` | Pure Rust, cross-platform |
| WebView2 (Windows) | `window.chrome.webview.postMessage()` | Native Win API |
| WKWebView (macOS/iOS) | `window.webkit.messageHandlers.bridge.postMessage()` | Apple API |
| CEF (Chromium) | JS Bindings + IPC Events | Chromium internal messaging |
| Electron | `ipcRenderer` / `ipcMain` | Node.js heavy |

---

## Best Practices for PDX IPC Design:

| Principle | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| JSON messages | Easy to parse & portable |
| `action` field | Explicit intent = secure |
| `args` object | Structured data for commands |
| JS API like SDK | Clean dev experience |
| Result callbacks | Consistent async handling |

---

## Example: PDX IPC API Spec (Mini)

```js
PDX.request("runShader", { data: "foo" }).then(result => { })
PDX.request("decryptCipher", { path: "cipher.pdx" }).then(data => { })
PDX.request("storeData", { key: "theme", value: "dark" }).then(ok => { })
```

---

# Final Recap:

| Layer | Role |
|-------|------|
| WebView JS | UI + User interaction |
| IPC Bridge | Message bus JS ↔ Rust |
| Native Rust | Core Logic: Wasmtime, WGPU, PrimJS, FileSystem, Crypto |
| WASM | User-defined Cipher logic (safe sandbox) |

# Want me to:
- Build the full PDX IPC SDK (JS & Rust sides)?
- Generate JS API ready for frontend devs?
- Build code that auto-routes IPC actions to Rust functions?
- Diagram message flow end-to-end?
