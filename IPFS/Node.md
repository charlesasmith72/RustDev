An **IPFS node** is a participant in the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) network. Hereâ€™s what that means:

- **Peer in a Decentralized Network:** An IPFS node is an instance of the IPFS software running on a device (like a computer or server). When you run the IPFS daemon, your machine becomes a node that connects with others, forming a distributed network.
- **Data Storage and Retrieval:** Each node stores and serves files using content addressing, which means files are identified by their cryptographic hash rather than by a location. This ensures data integrity and facilitates easy retrieval.
- **Network Contribution:** IPFS nodes help maintain the distributed hash table (DHT), a crucial component for locating and sharing content among nodes. They also cache and replicate data, enhancing the overall resilience and efficiency of the network.
- **Flexible Roles:** Nodes can act as full participants that store a complete copy of data, or as gateways that provide HTTP access to the IPFS network, making the decentralized content accessible via traditional web browsers.
