# IPFS Overview

**IPFS** (InterPlanetary File System) is a decentralized, peer-to-peer protocol for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system. Unlike traditional centralized systems, IPFS uses content addressing to identify files by their cryptographic hash rather than by location. This approach provides several key benefits:

- **Decentralization:** Files are distributed across a network of nodes, reducing reliance on a single server and enhancing the system's resilience.
- **Content Integrity:** Each file is uniquely identified by its hash, ensuring data integrity and enabling deduplication.
- **Efficient Data Distribution:** By leveraging a peer-to-peer network, IPFS can optimize bandwidth usage and speed up content delivery.
- **Versioning & Immutable Data Structures:** Using a Merkle Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), IPFS naturally supports version control and immutable data storage.
- **Enhanced Collaboration:** Its open-source nature and decentralized design make IPFS ideal for building distributed applications (dApps), decentralized websites, and collaborative projects.

IPFS is part of the broader movement towards a more open, resilient, and censorship-resistant web. For more detailed information or to get started, check out the [IPFS website](https://ipfs.io).
