## **3. Software & Compute Workflow**
### **3.1 WGPU Compute Workflow**
1. **Main PC reads a chunk of the 12TB binary dataset**.
2. **Splits the data into 32-byte vectors**.
3. **Sends each 32-byte vector batch to a PS4 node**.
4. **Each PS4 executes an XOR operation between sequential vectors**.
5. **Processed results are sent back to the main PC asynchronously**.
6. **Main PC aggregates the results and stores them back into storage**.

### **3.2 Data Format**
- **Input Format**:  
  - Binary file split into **32-byte vectors**.
  - Each vector is **XORed with the next vector**.

- **Output Format**:
  - Each PS4 sends back **processed 32-byte blocks** in **binary format**.
  - Data is reassembled on the **main PC**.

---

## **4. Technical Requirements**
### **4.1 Compute Shader Implementation**
- **WGPU Compute Shader (WGSL)**
  - Reads **32-byte vector input** from buffer.
  - **Performs XOR operation** between each vector and the next.
  - Writes **output back to the buffer**.

- **Memory Alignment Considerations**
  - Ensure **vectors are aligned to 32-byte boundaries**.
  - Optimize **memory reads/writes for AMD Polaris architecture**.

### **4.2 Networking Protocol**
- **Transport:** UDP (for lower latency)
- **Serialization:** MessagePack or Protobuf (to reduce payload size)
- **Batch Size:** 128-256 vectors per request (to optimize network efficiency)

### **4.3 Parallelization & Async Execution**
- **Main PC** runs a **Rust async service** using `tokio::spawn` to manage:
  - **Sending compute tasks in parallel**
  - **Listening for results asynchronously**
- **PS4 Compute Nodes** process tasks using a **Rust-based TCP/UDP server**.

---

## **5. Performance Considerations**
| **Metric** | **Expected Performance** |
|------------|--------------------------|
| **Network Bandwidth per PS4** | 1Gbps (theoretical max: 125MB/s) |
| **XOR Processing Speed (PS4 Pro GPU)** | ~4.2 TFLOPS (single precision) |
| **Total Compute Power (12 PS4s)** | ~50.4 TFLOPS |
| **Estimated Processing Time (12TB dataset)** | Dependent on async batch execution and network latency |

---

## **6. Fault Tolerance & Error Handling**
- **Timeout Handling**: If a PS4 node is **unresponsive**, reassign work to another node.
- **Checksum Validation**: Each processed batch should include a **hash to verify correctness**.
- **Node Monitoring**: Main PC logs **which nodes are active/inactive**.

---

## **7. Next Steps**
- **Prototype WGPU compute shader for XOR operations**.
- **Implement Rust-based async networking server for sending/receiving vectors**.
- **Test network bandwidth with PS4 Pro Linux nodes**.

## **1. Optimizing Network Throughput for 12 PS4 Pro GPUs**
Your main problem is **network bandwidth** when sending **petabytes of 32-byte binary vectors**. A **router-based LAN optimization** can **drastically improve data flow**.

### **Key Goals**
‚úÖ **Maximize network speed per PS4**  
‚úÖ **Minimize latency between your PC and PS4s**  
‚úÖ **Reduce packet loss & overhead for high-speed transfers**  
‚úÖ **Enable simultaneous GPU workloads efficiently**

## **2. Best Network Setup**
### **‚ö° Ideal Hardware**
1. **Multi-Gigabit Switch (10GbE)**
   - A **10GbE switch** ensures that **each PS4 has enough bandwidth**.
   - Example: **Netgear XS508M (8x 10GbE ports) + another switch for 12 ports**.

2. **Dedicated LAN Router with QoS (Quality of Service)**
   - A **high-end router with QoS & link aggregation** can balance traffic.
   - Example: **Ubiquiti EdgeRouter, MikroTik, or a Linux-based router**.

3. **CAT6/CAT7 Ethernet Cables**
   - Ensure each PS4 has **direct LAN connectivity** for full **Gigabit speeds**.
   - CAT6 supports **1Gbps+**, CAT7 supports **10Gbps**.

---

## **3. Optimized Network Configuration**
### **üîÑ Method 1: Direct Multi-Gigabit LAN Connections**
- **Each PS4 connects via 1Gbps Ethernet to the 10GbE switch**.
- **Main PC has a 10GbE connection to the switch**.
- **Each PS4 gets a full dedicated 1Gbps lane**.
- Reduces **bottlenecks** and maximizes **data transfer speeds**.

### **üñ•Ô∏è Method 2: Assign Static IPs for Faster Routing**
- Set **static IPs** for each PS4 to avoid DHCP slowdowns.
- Example:
  - **Main PC:** `192.168.1.1`
  - **PS4 #1:** `192.168.1.101`
  - **PS4 #2:** `192.168.1.102`
  - ...
  - **PS4 #12:** `192.168.1.112`

### **üì° Method 3: Use Parallel Asynchronous Transfers**
- Instead of **sending one job at a time**, use **multiple async jobs**.
- Example: **Split petabytes into batches & send them concurrently**.
- Use **Tokio async in Rust** for fast, non-blocking network requests.

### **üõ†Ô∏è Method 4: Use UDP Instead of TCP**
- TCP is **reliable** but **slower** due to acknowledgments.
- UDP allows **faster streaming** with low latency.
- Use **UDP with a checksum validation** to ensure data integrity.

### **üì• Method 5: Implement MessagePack or Protobuf**
- **Avoid JSON** (slow) and use **MessagePack or Protobuf**.
- Compresses **binary vectors efficiently** for faster network transfers.
