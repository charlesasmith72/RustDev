Absolutely ‚Äî let‚Äôs break down what it means to have a **"CIP-95-compatible wallet injected into `window.cardano`"** in your browser.

---

## üß† What Is `window.cardano`?

`window.cardano` is the **standard browser API entry point** for Cardano wallets.

It works like this:

- When a Cardano wallet (like Nami, Eternl, or your custom CIP-95 wallet) is installed or loaded,
- It **"injects" itself** into the `window.cardano` object
- dApps (like yours) can **find and connect to the wallet** by checking `window.cardano.<walletname>`

---

## ‚úÖ CIP-95 Extension: A Special Kind of Wallet Injection

CIP-95 defines **new governance-specific capabilities** ‚Äî it's an **extension of CIP-30**.

A **CIP-95-compatible wallet** must:

1. Appear under `window.cardano`
2. Provide an `enable({ extensions: [{ cip: 95 }] })` method
3. Expose extra methods like:
   - `getPubDRepKey()`
   - `getRegisteredPubStakeKeys()`
   - `signTx()`, `submitTx()` (overridden to support Conway-era TXs)

---

## üîß Example: What `window.cardano` Might Look Like

```js
window.cardano = {
  nami: {
    enable: async (options) => { ... },
    isEnabled: async () => true,
    getNetworkId: async () => 1,
    signTx: async (cborHex) => { ... },
    submitTx: async (signedHex) => { ... }
  },
  mywasmwallet: {
    enable: async ({ extensions }) => {
      if (extensions.some(ext => ext.cip === 95)) {
        return {
          getPubDRepKey: async () => "...",
          signTx: async (txCborHex) => "...",
          submitTx: async (txHex) => "txHash"
        };
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## ‚úÖ Why This Matters for You

If you‚Äôre building your own **Rust + WASM Cardano wallet**, you can:

- Inject your wallet into `window.cardano.mywasmwallet`
- Implement the **CIP-95 extension spec**
- Let dApps and your own frontend talk to it like this:

```js
const wallet = await window.cardano.mywasmwallet.enable({
  extensions: [{ cip: 95 }]
});

const drepKey = await wallet.getPubDRepKey();
const signed = await wallet.signTx(cborHex);
await wallet.submitTx(signed);
```

---

## üîê Security Consideration

CIP-95 wallets must:
- Prompt user to allow access when `enable()` is called
- Only expose keys/methods relevant to governance (no private keys!)

---

## ‚úÖ TL;DR

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `window.cardano` | Browser-global object where Cardano wallets inject themselves |
| CIP-95-compatible wallet | A wallet that implements `signTx()`, governance certs, and extensions for Conway |
| `enable({ extensions: [{ cip: 95 }] })` | How a dApp requests access to a CIP-95 wallet |
| Why inject? | To create a secure, standardized bridge between your browser app and the wallet |

Would you like:
- A working injection template in vanilla JS?
- A browser demo that interacts with your injected WASM wallet?
- A validator for your `window.cardano.mywallet` object?
