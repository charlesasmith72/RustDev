Plutus scripts on Cardano can do a lot — they are the core of **smart contract logic** on the network. Here's a breakdown of what **Plutus scripts can do**, along with examples to give you a solid picture:

---

### 🔐 1. **Validate Transactions (Validators)**
Plutus scripts define rules for when a transaction is allowed to spend a particular output.

#### ✅ Example:
- A wallet can only spend an output **if it provides a certain signature**, a deadline has passed, or a specific condition is met.
- Think of it like: "You can only open this box if you have the right key or it's after Tuesday."

---

### 🪙 2. **Custom Minting/Burning Rules**
Plutus scripts can define how **native tokens** or **NFTs** are minted or burned using **minting policies**.

#### ✅ Example:
- Only a certain wallet can mint new tokens.
- NFTs can only be minted once per unique input (to enforce uniqueness).

---

### 🏦 3. **Build Decentralized Applications (dApps)**
Plutus lets you build logic for decentralized finance (DeFi), games, marketplaces, etc.

#### ✅ Example Use Cases:
- **DEXes** (like Minswap or SundaeSwap)
- **Lending/Borrowing platforms**
- **Escrow services**
- **DAO governance rules**
- **NFT marketplaces**

---

### ⛓️ 4. **Multi-signature Conditions**
Scripts can enforce that **multiple parties** must approve a transaction.

#### ✅ Example:
- Require 2-of-3 signatures to release funds from a DAO treasury.

---

### 📅 5. **Time-based Logic**
Plutus can use **slot numbers** or **timestamps** to enforce deadlines.

#### ✅ Example:
- A crowdfunding contract that refunds users **if the goal isn’t met by a certain time**.

---

### 🧩 6. **Custom Business Logic**
Since it’s based on Haskell, you can write **complex logic** using types, pattern matching, and even cryptographic functions.

#### ✅ Example:
- A game where winners can claim a reward if they submit a solution that hashes to a secret.

### 📦 Types of Plutus Scripts

| Script Type        | Purpose                                 |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Validator Script** | Controls spending of UTxOs              |
| **Minting Policy**   | Controls minting/burning of native tokens |
| **Stake Validator**  | Controls staking-related behavior       |
