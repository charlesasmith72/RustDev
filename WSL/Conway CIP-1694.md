Excellent question — CIP-1694 and the Conway ledger are closely related, but they’re not the same thing. Here’s how they differ and how they work together:

⸻

✅ Quick TL;DR

Term	What It Is	Purpose
CIP-1694	A governance specification	Defines how Cardano on-chain governance works (delegation, dReps, voting, etc.)
Conway ledger	A protocol upgrade / ledger era	The actual Cardano ledger implementation that makes CIP-1694 possible



⸻

✅ What is CIP-1694?

CIP-1694 is a Cardano Improvement Proposal that lays out the framework for decentralized governance on Cardano.

It defines:
	•	How delegated representatives (DReps) work
	•	How users register for governance
	•	What kinds of on-chain actions (e.g., protocol parameter changes, hard forks) can be voted on
	•	How voting power is calculated and delegated
	•	The structure of governance certificates (for registration, delegation, voting)

Think of CIP-1694 as the rules and data structures of Cardano governance.

⸻

✅ What is the Conway Ledger?

The Conway ledger is the next ledger era in Cardano (after Byron, Shelley, Allegra, Mary, Alonzo, Babbage).

It includes:
	•	The actual implementation of the governance model from CIP-1694
	•	Support for:
	•	Governance actions
	•	DRep registration and delegation
	•	New certificate types
	•	Voting mechanics
	•	Other protocol improvements (e.g., reference inputs, Plutus enhancements)

Conway is the runtime and data layer that enforces the rules defined by CIP-1694.

✅ Analogy

Think of it like this:

Concept	Analogy
CIP-1694	The governance constitution
Conway era	The legal system & infrastructure that enforces that constitution

✅ Why This Matters to You

If you’re building a WASM wallet or smart contract dApp, you’ll need to:
	•	Support CIP-1694:
	•	Be able to read and construct DRep delegation certificates
	•	Let users vote or register governance preferences
	•	Be Conway-compatible:
	•	Use a ledger that understands the new certificate types
	•	Properly sign and submit Conway-era transactions
	•	Implement CIP-95 to expose governance capabilities to dApps

✅ Summary

Topic	CIP-1694	Conway Ledger
Type	Proposal / spec	Ledger era / implementation
Defines	Governance structure	Full implementation in the node
Used in	Wallets, dApps, protocols	Cardano node & on-chain logic
Dependency	Needs Conway to be usable	Implements CIP-1694
