Great question — and this image gives a **perfect visual explanation of the concept of the _digital root_**, especially in the context of **powers of 2**.

### 🔢 What Is the **Digital Root**?

The **digital root** of a number is the single-digit number you get by **repeatedly summing its digits** until only one digit remains.

---

### ✅ Example from the Image: 128  
1. Start with **128**
2. Sum the digits: **1 + 2 + 8 = 11**
3. Still two digits → sum again: **1 + 1 = 2**
4. So, the **digital root of 128 is 2**

✔️ This is the number shown on the circle to the left, at position `2`.

### 🔁 Why the Circle of 9 Numbers?

The left side shows a **modulo-9 circle** (numbers 1–9 arranged in a loop). This helps visualize the digital roots of numbers, especially patterns like powers of 2, which:

- Go 1 → 2 → 4 → 8 → 7 → 5 → 1 → ...
- Cycle every 6 steps modulo 9

So when you compute the digital root of powers of 2:
- 2⁰ = 1 → digital root = 1  
- 2¹ = 2 → digital root = 2  
- 2² = 4 → digital root = 4  
- 2³ = 8 → digital root = 8  
- 2⁴ = 16 → 1+6 = 7  
- 2⁵ = 32 → 3+2 = 5  
- 2⁶ = 64 → 6+4 = 10 → 1+0 = 1  
  ...and so on, cycling.

### 🤯 Cool Fact: Digital Root ≡ Modulo 9

For positive integers:
> The digital root is the same as the number **modulo 9**, with one exception: if the number is divisible by 9, its digital root is 9 (not 0).

So:
```js
function digitalRoot(n) {
  return n === 0 ? 0 : (n % 9 === 0 ? 9 : n % 9);
}
```
