When you insert or retrieve a key in a `HashMap`, Rust needs to compute a numeric hash for that key. This process calls the `Hash` trait’s methods under the hood. Below is a more detailed look at what happens in that step.

---

## 1. The `Hash` Trait

Any type that can be used as a key in a `HashMap` must implement the [`Hash`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/hash/trait.Hash.html) trait, which looks like this (simplified):

```rust
pub trait Hash {
    fn hash<H: Hasher>(&self, state: &mut H);
}
```

- **`Hash`**: The trait.  
- **`hash(&self, state: &mut H)`**: The method that feeds the **bits of `self`** (the key) into the given hasher (`H`).

Rust’s built-in types (like `i32`, `String`, slices, etc.) already implement `Hash` in a sensible way. For custom structs, you can implement `Hash` (and typically `Eq`) if you want to use them as keys in a `HashMap`.

---

## 2. How the Key’s Bits Are Fed into the Hasher

When you do something like:

```rust
let mut my_map = std::collections::HashMap::new();
my_map.insert("some_key", "some_value");
```

the `HashMap` will internally do something like this (pseudocode):

```rust
// 1. Acquire the default hasher
let mut hasher = my_map.hasher().build_hasher();

// 2. Call the key's `hash` method
"some_key".hash(&mut hasher);

// 3. Finalize the hasher to get a u64
let hash_value = hasher.finish();
```

### What happens in `some_key.hash(&mut hasher)`?

- Rust calls the `hash` method on the `&str` `"some_key"`.  
- That method knows how to iterate over the bytes of the string, feeding them into `hasher.write(...)`.  
- Under the hood, the key’s data is broken into some chunk format that the hasher can process. For a string, it’ll likely do something like:
  ```rust
  impl Hash for &str {
      fn hash<H: Hasher>(&self, state: &mut H) {
          state.write(self.as_bytes());
          state.write_usize(self.len());
      }
  }
  ```
  (Exact implementations can vary; the above is a simplified example.)

- The hasher’s internal state updates accordingly each time data is “written” to it.

---

## 3. The Role of the `Hasher` Trait

The [`Hasher`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/hash/trait.Hasher.html) trait defines methods like:

- `write(&mut self, bytes: &[u8])`
- `finish(&self) -> u64`
- Possibly specialized methods like `write_u32`, `write_usize`, etc.

When the key’s `hash` method calls `state.write(...)`, it’s pushing the key’s bytes into the hasher. The `Hasher` then mixes those bits (through whatever algorithm it uses) into its internal state.

At the very end, the map calls `hasher.finish()` to get a final 64-bit hash value.

---

## 4. The Default Hasher in `HashMap`

By default, `HashMap` uses a hasher chosen by the standard library (historically SipHash, more recently AHash in some implementations). This helps avoid trivial collisions and has some resistance to DOS-style attacks. However, if you need a special hasher (for cryptographic or performance reasons), you can specify it:

```rust
use std::hash::{BuildHasherDefault, Hasher};

struct MyFastHasher(u64);

impl Hasher for MyFastHasher {
    fn write(&mut self, bytes: &[u8]) {
        // Some custom hashing logic
        for b in bytes {
            self.0 ^= *b as u64;
            // etc...
        }
    }
    fn finish(&self) -> u64 {
        self.0
    }
}

type MyBuildHasher = BuildHasherDefault<MyFastHasher>;

fn main() {
    use std::collections::HashMap;

    // Use the custom hasher
    let mut map: HashMap<_, _, MyBuildHasher> = HashMap::default();

    map.insert("key", "value");
}
```

This example demonstrates how you could supply your own hasher, but most users rely on the default hasher.

---

## 5. Putting It All Together

1. **You call `insert(key, value)`** or `get(&key)` on the `HashMap`.  
2. **The `HashMap` obtains a hasher** (either from the default or a custom builder).  
3. **`hash(&self, &mut H)` is called on the key**, which:  
   - Breaks down the key’s data into bytes.  
   - Calls `hasher.write(bytes)`.  
4. **The `Hasher` mixes** those bytes into its internal state.  
5. **`finish()`** finalizes that state into a `u64` hash value.  
6. **`HashMap` converts that hash** to a bucket index (something like `hash_value % capacity`) and uses that to place the key-value pair (or to look it up).

---

### Key Takeaways

- The `Hash` trait defines **how** a key’s data is turned into a series of bytes that feed into the hasher.  
- The `Hasher` trait defines **how** those bytes are **combined** into a single numeric hash.  
- When you insert or look up a key, the `HashMap` does **both** steps internally, behind the scenes, using the key’s `hash` implementation and the hasher’s logic.  

With these details, you can see how Rust transforms a key into a final numeric hash for indexing in a `HashMap`. Most of the time, you don’t need to worry about these internals—just let Rust do its work. But if you have custom data structures, or performance/security concerns, you can provide your own implementations of `Hash` or `Hasher` to customize the process.
Below is a **super-simplified** example of how you might replicate the core steps of “hashing a key, then mapping it into a bucket index.” Real Rust code uses traits like `Hash` and `Hasher`, and a more sophisticated algorithm. However, this snippet shows the **basic idea** from scratch:

```rust
/// A very simplistic "hasher" that just sums the bytes of a string.
/// This is NOT a secure or collision-resistant approach—it's purely for demonstration.
fn very_basic_hasher(input: &str) -> u64 {
    let mut sum: u64 = 0;
    for &byte in input.as_bytes() {
        // Use wrapping_add to avoid overflow panics
        sum = sum.wrapping_add(byte as u64);
    }
    sum
}

/// Takes the hashed value and maps it into a "bucket index"
/// by using modulo arithmetic. Again, simplified demonstration only.
fn get_bucket_index(hash_value: u64, bucket_count: usize) -> usize {
    (hash_value as usize) % bucket_count
}

/// Combines the above steps: hashes a string key, then computes which bucket index it should go in.
fn basic_hash_insert(key: &str, bucket_count: usize) -> usize {
    // 1. Hash the key (turn it into a numeric value).
    let hash_val = very_basic_hasher(key);

    // 2. Convert the hash value to a bucket index.
    let index = get_bucket_index(hash_val, bucket_count);

    // In a real HashMap, you'd now store the key-value pair in that bucket.
    // For this demo, we just return the index.
    index
}

fn main() {
    let buckets = 16;
    let key = "Hello, galaxy!";

    // Insert the key and figure out which bucket it goes into.
    let bucket_index = basic_hash_insert(key, buckets);

    println!("Key: '{}', Hash Bucket Index: {}", key, bucket_index);
}
```

### What This Demonstration Does

1. **`very_basic_hasher(input: &str) -> u64`**  
   - Iterates over each byte in the string.  
   - Adds (`wrapping_add`) that byte to a running sum.  
   - Returns a final 64-bit integer that (very loosely) represents the string.  

2. **`get_bucket_index(hash_value: u64, bucket_count: usize) -> usize`**  
   - Takes the hash value and does a `% bucket_count` to pick which “bucket” it belongs to, simulating how a hash map stores items internally.  

3. **`basic_hash_insert(key, bucket_count)`**  
   - Combines those steps:  
     1. Hashes the key with `very_basic_hasher`.  
     2. Computes the bucket index with `get_bucket_index`.  
     3. Returns that index.  

4. **`main()`**  
   - Shows how you might use these helper functions.  

### Important Caveats

- **This is not how real hashing or Rust’s standard `HashMap` works internally.** They use more sophisticated (and safer) algorithms.  
- **Security & Collision Resistance**: This simplistic approach (just summing bytes) is extremely collision-prone and not cryptographically secure.  
- **Production Rust**: Normally, you’d rely on Rust’s `std::hash` and `std::collections::HashMap` to do everything for you automatically, rather than writing your own hasher.  

Still, this toy example illustrates the **core mechanics**:  
1. Turn the key into a numeric “hash.”  
2. Use modulo arithmetic to pick a bucket index.  
3. (If this were a real map, handle collisions in that bucket.)

Use this as a learning tool to see how hashing and indexing fundamentally work behind the scenes.
