# Learning Lattice for Rust Crates

Welcome to my GitHub project, where I document my journey in learning **Lattice** and its application in **Rust crates**. This repository will serve as a reference for concepts, implementations, and experiments related to **Lattice-based computations, data structures, and optimizations** in Rust.

## 📌 Topics Covered

### 🔹 Introduction to Lattice
- What is Lattice?
- Why use Lattice in Rust?
- Common use cases in computer science and cryptography.

### 🔹 Lattice-Based Data Structures
- Implementing ordered and distributive lattices in Rust.
- Using **partially ordered sets (posets)**.
- Building **join-semilattices** and **meet-semilattices**.

### 🔹 Lattice in Cryptography & Hashing
- Basics of lattice-based cryptography.
- Using **Lattice Reduction** techniques.
- Exploring **lattice-based hashing**.

### 🔹 Lattice in Vector Databases & Machine Learning
- How Lattice structures optimize **vector search**.
- Potential use in **vector embeddings** and **approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search**.

### 🔹 Implementing Lattice Algorithms in Rust
- Writing efficient **fixed-point** computations using lattices.
- Designing **Rust traits** for lattice operations.
- Benchmarking different implementations for performance.

### 🔹 Practical Applications
- Applying Lattice structures in **distributed computing**.
- How lattices can be useful in **blockchain** and **homomorphic encryption**.
- Exploring lattice-based **error-correcting codes**.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/learning-lattice-rust.git
   cd learning-lattice-rust
   ```

2. Install Rust if you haven't already:
   ```sh
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```

3. Build and run examples:
   ```sh
   cargo build
   cargo run --example lattice_demo
   ```
