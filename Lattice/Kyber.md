The easiest Rust crate to start learning **lattice-based cryptography** and **Kyber** depends on how comfortable you are with cryptography and Rust itself. Here's a breakdown:

1. **[ml-kem (RustCrypto)](https://docs.rs/ml-kem)** – **Easiest Learning Curve**  
   - Part of the well-documented **RustCrypto** ecosystem.  
   - Designed for correctness and security with clear APIs.  
   - If you’re familiar with how RustCrypto libraries work, this will feel intuitive.  
   - **Best for beginners in Kyber who want a structured, well-supported library.**

2. **[enc_rust](https://lib.rs/crates/enc_rust)** – **Moderate Difficulty**  
   - Aims to be a pure Rust implementation of **ML-KEM (Kyber)** and **ML-DSA (Dilithium)**.  
   - Good for those who want to understand Kyber and post-quantum cryptography at a deeper level.  
   - Might be harder for beginners due to its focus on cryptographic precision and `no_std` compliance.

3. **[KyberLib](https://kyberlib.com)** – **Advanced Difficulty**  
   - Low-level implementation with a focus on efficiency (`no_std`, optimized AVX2).  
   - Best if you are working on embedded systems or optimizing cryptographic performance.  
   - Requires a solid understanding of cryptography and Rust's memory model.

### **Recommendation for Learning**
- If you want the easiest starting point, **go with `ml-kem` from RustCrypto**.
- If you want to understand Kyber deeply but still in a manageable way, **`enc_rust` is a good balance**.
- If you need low-level control or `no_std` support, **use `KyberLib`**.
