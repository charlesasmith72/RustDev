# DBG!
The **`dbg!`** macro in Rust is a simple and powerful debugging tool that allows you to quickly inspect and print the value of an expression along with its file, line number, and column.

---

## Features of `dbg!`
1. **Quick Debugging**:
   - Prints the value of an expression and returns ownership of the value.
   - Useful for temporary debugging during development.
   
2. **Debug Information**:
   - Includes the file name, line number, and column where it was called.

3. **Works with All Types**:
   - Requires the type to implement the `Debug` trait.

## Basic Usage
```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let y = dbg!(x * 2); // Prints: [src/main.rs:4] x * 2 = 10

    println!("y = {}", y); // Output: y = 10
}
```

### Output:
```
[src/main.rs:4] x * 2 = 10
y = 10
```

## Key Characteristics
- **Side Effect**: Prints to `stderr`, not `stdout`.
- **Returns the Value**: Allows you to use the result of the macro in your program.

### Example:
```rust
fn main() {
    let vec = vec![1, 2, 3];
    dbg!(vec.len()); // Prints: [src/main.rs:3] vec.len() = 3
}
```

---

## Using `dbg!` with Complex Expressions
You can use `dbg!` to inspect complex expressions or entire data structures:
```rust
fn main() {
    let numbers = vec![1, 2, 3, 4];
    let sum: i32 = dbg!(numbers.iter().sum()); // Debugs the result of the sum
}
```

### Output:
```
[src/main.rs:4] numbers.iter().sum() = 10
```

---

## `dbg!` in Loops
The `dbg!` macro is especially useful in loops for debugging intermediate values:
```rust
fn main() {
    for i in 0..5 {
        dbg!(i); // Debug each value of `i`
    }
}
```

### Output:
```
[src/main.rs:3] i = 0
[src/main.rs:3] i = 1
[src/main.rs:3] i = 2
[src/main.rs:3] i = 3
[src/main.rs:3] i = 4
```

---

## Caveats
1. **Performance**:
   - Not intended for production use. Ensure to remove `dbg!` calls after debugging.

2. **Requires `Debug` Trait**:
   - Types used in `dbg!` must implement the `Debug` trait. Most standard types already implement it.

## When to Use `dbg!`
- Quickly inspect variable values.
- Debug expressions during iteration or function calls.
- Print structured data for quick insights.
