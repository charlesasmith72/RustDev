### 🧰 Key Tools and Components in Lynx

1. **PrimJS**  
   A lightweight JavaScript engine based on QuickJS, PrimJS powers the main UI thread in Lynx. This setup allows for efficient handling of UI tasks and contributes to smoother performance by separating UI rendering from business logic. citeturn0search4

2. **Dual-Threaded Architecture**  
   Lynx employs a dual-threaded model, where the main thread manages UI rendering and user interactions, while a secondary thread handles application logic and data processing. This separation enhances responsiveness and reduces UI lag, especially in complex applications. citeturn0search4

3. **Rspack**  
   A Rust-based module bundler, Rspack is used in Lynx for efficient project bundling. It offers faster build times compared to traditional JavaScript bundlers, contributing to an improved development experience. citeturn0search10

4. **ReactLynx**  
   For developers familiar with React, Lynx offers ReactLynx, a variant that supports JSX and integrates seamlessly with the React ecosystem. This allows for a smoother transition for React developers into the Lynx framework. citeturn0search4

5. **Native CSS Styling**  
   Lynx supports standard CSS for styling, including features like transitions, animations, and modern visual effects. This approach enables web developers to apply their existing CSS knowledge directly when building native applications. citeturn0search4

6. **Lynx Explorer App**  
   A companion application that allows developers to preview and test their Lynx applications on mobile devices in real-time, facilitating rapid development and debugging. citeturn0search10
