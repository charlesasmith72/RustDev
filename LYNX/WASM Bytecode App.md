Absolutely — this is an advanced modern architecture.

## Project Goal:
> *Universal WASM Bytecode App*  
Single Rust codebase → produces 1 .wasm → runs:
- In Browsers (WebAssembly + glue.js)
- In Desktop Apps (Rust + wry WebView)

Optional: Optimize assets using:
- PrimJS (minimal JS engine for desktop only)
- Rspack (Rust Web bundler for browser builds)

## Final Architecture Overview Diagram:

                             ↓
         +---------------------------------------------+
         | Common Rust + wasm-bindgen app logic        |
         | export JS-friendly APIs using #[wasm_bindgen] |
         +---------------------------------------------+

wasm_bg.wasm                  wasm_bg.wasm (identical)
wasm.js / glue.js            wasm.js / glue.js (identical)
HTML/CSS assets              HTML/CSS assets (identical)
Bundle via Rspack            Embedded locally in Rust/wry
                           + Optional PrimJS (JS Engine Replacement)

## Key Technologies Breakdown:

| Tech | Role | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| Rust | Main App Logic | Performance, portability |
| wasm-bindgen | JS bridge | Expose functions to JS cleanly |
| wasm-pack | Build tool | Generates wasm + glue.js |
| wry | Desktop Runtime | Embeds WebView with full browser capabilities |
| PrimJS (Optional) | Desktop JS engine | For no-WebView minimal JS execution |
| Rspack | Asset Bundler | Like Webpack, faster Rust-based bundling |

## Folder Structure Suggestion:

```
universal-wasm-app/
├── src/               # Rust source code (shared)
├── assets/            # HTML / CSS / JS / icons
│   └── index.html
│   └── style.css
│   └── logo.png
├── pkg/               # wasm-pack output
│   └── wasm_bg.wasm
│   └── wasm.js
│   └── package.json
├── desktop/           # Desktop Rust app using wry
│   └── src/main.rs
├── rspack.config.js   # Optional Web bundler config
├── Cargo.toml
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

---

## Desktop Rust (wry) Setup

Cargo.toml:
```toml
[dependencies]
wry = "0.29"
base64 = "0.21"
```

Rust Loader (Desktop):
```rust
webview.evaluate_script("import('/wasm.js').then(m => { m.default().then(()=> m.greet('Desktop')) })")?;
```

Serve `assets/` locally:
- OR embed them in Rust with `include_str!()` or `tauri::Asset` equivalent.

---

## Browser Setup

Using Rspack (optional for speed over Webpack):

rspack.config.js:
```js
module.exports = {
  entry: "./assets/index.html",
  output: {
    path: "./dist",
  },
};
```

Use:
```bash
rspack build
```

Produces super-optimized browser bundle.

---

## Desktop Optimization with PrimJS (Optional Advanced)

PrimJS could replace wry WebView *if* you don't need HTML rendering but just JS execution (CLI / minimal UI).

Rust loads WASM → Controls PrimJS VM → Exposes necessary JS APIs (simulating DOM etc)

PrimJS is perfect for:
- Game logic
- Data logic
- Plugins
- No browser required

BUT: Web UI needs WebView (wry) unless headless.

---

## Final Runtime Targets:

| Target | WASM Runtime | JS Engine | UI Layer |
|--------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| Browser | Browser WebAssembly | Browser JS | DOM |
| Desktop WebView | wry | Chromium/WebKit | DOM |
| Desktop Minimal | Wasmtime | PrimJS | Headless or CLI |

---

## Result Benefits:

| Benefit | Why It Rocks |
|---------|--------------|
| Single WASM file | One build, many platforms |
| Shared JS code | wasm-bindgen provides clean API |
| Full Web Capabilities | DOM, CSS, HTML available |
| Rust Power | File access, OS features (desktop only) |
| Optional PrimJS | JS Execution without browser |
| Optional Rspack | Super fast web bundling |

## Next Step Offer:

Would you like me to:
- Build full starter repo?
- Provide working universal wasm-bindgen code?
- Desktop & Browser runners pre-configured?
- Optional PrimJS integration for advanced CLI builds?
- Full documentation ready?

Say:
> "Build me universal wasm runtime starter"

And I will do it and upload ready-to-run code for you.
