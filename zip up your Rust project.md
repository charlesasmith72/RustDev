Yes, you can zip up your Rust project and run it on another machine with a similar environment, but there are a few factors to consider:

### **1. If the Target Machine Has Rust Installed**
- If the machine has Rust installed, you can simply unzip the folder and run:
  ```sh
  cargo build --release
  ```
  or
  ```sh
  cargo run --release
  ```
  This will compile and run your crate.

### **2. If You Want to Run Without Recompiling**
- You need to **cross-compile** or **build on the target machine** and then zip the **binary**.
- To do this:
  ```sh
  cargo build --release
  ```
  The compiled binary will be inside `target/release/your_crate_name`.

- Zip the binary:
  ```sh
  zip -r my_crate.zip target/release/your_crate_name
  ```

- On the target machine, unzip and run:
  ```sh
  ./your_crate_name
  ```

### **3. If Your Crate Has Dependencies (Libraries)**
- If your crate depends on dynamic libraries (like `libssl`, `libsqlite`, etc.), ensure they are available on the target machine.
- You can check dependencies with:
  ```sh
  ldd target/release/your_crate_name  # On Linux
  otool -L target/release/your_crate_name  # On macOS
  ```
- If needed, use `static linking` when building.

### **4. If You Need a Fully Portable Deployment**
- Consider using `musl` for Linux:
  ```sh
  rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
  cargo build --release --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
  ```
- For Windows, ensure you have the right runtime dependencies (`msvcp140.dll`, `vcruntime140.dll`, etc.).
