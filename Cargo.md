# Cargo Features  

## Platform-Specific Builds
- Cargo allows platform-specific dependencies or code using conditional compilation with `cfg` attributes.
- Use `[target.'cfg(windows)'.dependencies]` in `Cargo.toml` to specify dependencies unique to Windows.

## Cross-Compilation
- Rust supports cross-compilation for different Windows architectures, including x86, x86_64, and ARM.
- Use `cargo build --target <triple>` where `<triple>` is a Windows target like `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` or `i686-pc-windows-msvc`.

## Windows-Specific Cargo Commands
- **`cargo install`**: Install CLI tools targeting Windows.
- **`cargo run`**: Automatically sets up the Windows environment during execution.
- **`cargo test`**: Execute tests with Windows-specific behaviors using conditional compilation.

## MSVC vs. GNU Toolchains
- Rust supports both MSVC and GNU

## Cargo Commands for `rustc`

Cargo, the Rust package manager, works in tandem with `rustc` (the Rust compiler) to streamline development. Below are key Cargo commands related to `rustc`:

---

### 1. **Run a Program**
Compile and run your Rust code:
```bash
cargo run
```
This internally calls `rustc` to compile and execute the binary.

---

### 2. **Build a Project**
Compile the project but do not run it:
```bash
cargo build
```
This generates an executable in the `target/debug` directory. For optimized builds:
```bash
cargo build --release
```
This calls `rustc` with the `--release` flag, enabling optimizations.

---

### 3. **Quiet Mode**
Suppress non-essential output during build or run:
```bash
cargo build --quiet
cargo run --quiet
```
This minimizes output, showing only errors or critical information.

---

### 4. **Directly Pass Flags to `rustc`**
Use the `--` separator to forward flags to `rustc`:
```bash
cargo rustc -- [flags]
```
Example: Add debugging symbols:
```bash
cargo rustc -- -g
```

---

### 5. **View Compiler Version**
Check the version of the Rust compiler (`rustc`) Cargo is using:
```bash
cargo version
rustc --version
```

---

### 6. **Custom Compile Flags**
Set custom flags using the `RUSTFLAGS` environment variable:
```bash
RUSTFLAGS="-C opt-level=2" cargo build
```

---

### 7. **Check Code Without Building**
Verify if the code compiles without creating an executable:
```bash
cargo check
```
This is faster than `cargo build` as it skips artifact generation.

---

### 8. **Test Compilation**
Compile and run test cases:
```bash
cargo test
```

---

### 9. **Clean Build Artifacts**
Remove compiled files (useful for debugging or saving disk space):
```bash
cargo clean
```

---

### 10. **Inspect Build Process**
To understand how `rustc` is invoked during the build, use:
```bash
cargo build --verbose
```

---

### 11. **Compile Single File with `rustc`**
If you need to use `rustc` directly without Cargo:
```bash
rustc file.rs
```
However, for complex projects with dependencies, Cargo is recommended.

This note now includes **Quiet Mode**, which is especially useful when focusing on error handling or when you prefer less cluttered output. Let me know if you’d like further clarifications!

To build a blank Rust project with a `hello_world.rs` file in the directory, follow these steps:

---

### 1. **Create a Blank Rust Project**
Use Cargo to initialize a new Rust project:

```bash
cargo new my_project
```

This creates a new directory called `my_project` with the following structure:

```
my_project/
├── Cargo.toml
└── src/
    └── main.rs
```

---

### 2. **Replace or Add `hello_world.rs`**
If you already have a `hello_world.rs` file:
1. Move `hello_world.rs` into the `src` directory:
   ```bash
   mv hello_world.rs my_project/src/
   ```

2. Rename `hello_world.rs` to `main.rs` (the entry point for the program):
   ```bash
   mv my_project/src/hello_world.rs my_project/src/main.rs
   ```

---

### 3. **Write Code in `hello_world.rs`**
Ensure your `hello_world.rs` file has a basic Rust program:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

---

### 4. **Build the Project**
Navigate to your project directory and build it using Cargo:
```bash
cd my_project
cargo build
```

This compiles the project and creates an executable in the `target/debug` directory.

---

### 5. **Run the Executable**
Run the compiled executable:
```bash
cargo run
```

Expected Output:
```
Hello, world!
```

---

### Alternative: Build Without Cargo
If you only have the `hello_world.rs` file and don’t want to use Cargo, compile it directly with `rustc`:

```bash
rustc hello_world.rs
./hello_world
```

This produces an executable named `hello_world` in the same directory.
